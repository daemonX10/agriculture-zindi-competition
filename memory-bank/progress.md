# Progress: Zindi Agriculture Competition

## Current Status

- Initial project setup phase
- Memory Bank structure established
- Starter notebook reviewed and understood

## What Works

- Basic data loading for GeoTIFF files and GeoJSON data
- Initial visualization of satellite imagery
- Computation of basic vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI)
- Basic feature extraction from spectral bands
- Simple Random Forest classifier implementation
- Submission file generation process

## What's Left to Build

- Enhanced feature engineering pipeline
- Multi-temporal data integration
- Advanced model architectures
- Cross-validation framework
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Feature importance analysis
- Performance visualization dashboard
- Optimized prediction pipeline

## Known Issues

- Current approach only uses single-date imagery (January 2024)
- Baseline model likely suboptimal for competition requirements
- Need for improved handling of variable-sized fields
- Limited feature set extracted from available bands
- No texture or contextual features implemented yet
- Basic model with default hyperparameters

## Progress Tracking

| Component           | Status     | Priority | Notes                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Data Loading        | ✅ Basic   | Medium   | Can load images but needs optimization |
| Preprocessing       | ⚠️ Minimal | High     | Only basic normalization implemented   |
| Feature Engineering | ⚠️ Basic   | High     | Only standard vegetation indices       |
| Model Training      | ⚠️ Basic   | Medium   | Only Random Forest implemented         |
| Evaluation          | ⚠️ Basic   | Medium   | Simple accuracy metrics only           |
| Submission          | ✅ Working | Low      | Can generate submission file           |
