# Technical Context: Zindi Agriculture Competition

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages

- **Python**: Primary language for data processing and model development

### Core Libraries

- **rasterio**: For reading and processing GeoTIFF satellite imagery
- **geopandas**: For handling geospatial data and GeoJSON files
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and array handling
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models (RandomForest, etc.)
- **matplotlib/seaborn/plotly**: For visualization of data and results

### Specialized Libraries

- **GDAL**: Underlying library for geospatial data operations
- **rasterstats**: For extracting statistics from raster data
- **tqdm**: For progress tracking during long-running operations

## Development Setup

- Jupyter Notebooks for iterative development and visualization
- Local development environment with required Python packages
- Option to use Google Colab for processing with GPU acceleration

## Technical Constraints

- Memory limitations when processing large satellite images
- Computational intensity of extracting features from multiple temporal images
- Handling variations in image quality and cloud cover
- Processing speed limitations for large datasets

## Dependencies

- **Sentinel-2 Data**: Multi-spectral satellite imagery with specific bands
  - B2 (Blue), B3 (Green), B4 (Red): 10m resolution
  - B8 (NIR): 10m resolution
  - B11, B12 (SWIR bands): 20m resolution
- **Training Data**: GeoJSON files with field boundaries and crop labels
- **Test Data**: GeoJSON files with field boundaries for prediction

## Environment Configuration

- Python 3.8+ recommended
- Key package versions:
  - rasterio >= 1.2.0
  - geopandas >= 0.9.0
  - scikit-learn >= 1.0.0
  - numpy >= 1.20.0
