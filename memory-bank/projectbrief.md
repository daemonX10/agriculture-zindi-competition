# Project Brief: Zindi Agriculture Competition

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the CÃ´te d'Ivoire Byte-Sized Agriculture Challenge from Zindi. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify agricultural fields into three crop types (Cocoa, Palm, and Rubber) using satellite imagery from Sentinel-2.

## Core Requirements

1. Process and analyze Sentinel-2 satellite imagery of agricultural plots
2. Extract meaningful features from multi-spectral satellite bands
3. Build a classification model to identify crop types
4. Prepare predictions in the required submission format

## Project Goals

- Achieve high accuracy in crop type classification
- Leverage multi-temporal data (images across different months)
- Apply appropriate feature engineering techniques for satellite imagery
- Implement effective machine learning models for this specific task
- Submit predictions that meet the competition requirements

## Success Criteria

- Model performance measured by the competition's evaluation metric
- Ability to process all test data and generate valid predictions
- Submission format that complies with competition requirements
- Improvement over the baseline model provided in the starter notebook

## Constraints

- Limited by the data provided in the competition
- Must use the specified submission format
- Computationally intensive processing of satellite imagery
- Need to handle variations in image sizes and quality

## Timeline

- Competition deadline: [To be determined based on competition rules]
- Key milestones:
  1. Data exploration and understanding
  2. Feature engineering
  3. Model development and testing
  4. Final submission preparation
