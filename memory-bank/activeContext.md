## Next Steps

1. **Data Exploration**:

   - Analyze the full dataset structure and properties
   - Visualize the distribution of classes in training data
   - Examine spectral signatures of different crop types
   - Investigate image quality and potential preprocessing needs

2. **Feature Engineering Enhancement**:

   - Expand vegetation indices beyond NDVI, SAVI, and EVI
   - Explore texture-based features for crop differentiation
   - Implement multi-temporal features to capture seasonal patterns
   - Test feature selection to identify most important predictors

3. **Model Development**:
   - Implement more advanced classifiers beyond Random Forest
   - Test deep learning approaches if appropriate
   - Perform systematic hyperparameter tuning
   - Implement cross-validation for robust evaluation
