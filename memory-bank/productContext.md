# Product Context: Zindi Agriculture Competition

## Problem Statement

Agriculture is a critical sector in Côte d'Ivoire's economy, with crops like cocoa, palm oil, and rubber being major exports. Accurate identification and monitoring of these crop types is essential for agricultural planning, resource allocation, and food security assessment. Traditional methods of crop mapping through field surveys are time-consuming, expensive, and often impractical for large areas.

## Solution Approach

This project uses satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 to automatically classify agricultural fields into three crop types (Cocoa, Palm, and Rubber). By applying machine learning techniques to multi-spectral satellite data, we can create a model that accurately identifies crop types without the need for extensive ground surveys.

## User Experience Goals

- Data scientists and agricultural analysts should be able to use our model to:
  - Accurately classify agricultural fields by crop type
  - Understand which features are most important for classification
  - Apply the model to new satellite imagery for ongoing monitoring

## Stakeholders

- Competition organizers (Zindi)
- Agricultural planners and policymakers in Côte d'Ivoire
- Farmers and agricultural businesses
- Environmental monitoring agencies
- Data scientists and researchers in remote sensing

## Key Differentiators

- Use of multi-temporal data to capture seasonal crop patterns
- Emphasis on interpretable features derived from satellite bands
- Adaptation to variations in field size and imagery quality
- Efficient processing of large amounts of satellite data

## Success Measures

- Primary: Competition evaluation metric (likely accuracy or F1-score)
- Secondary:
  - Model generalizability to different regions
  - Processing efficiency and scalability
  - Feature importance insights that align with agricultural domain knowledge
